# Safe-Haven-Hackathon

This repository contains all the Datasets and the codes which are used in this Hackathon.<br><br>
The file names starting with "File_" define the record structure of each of the datasets used. The files "Analyse_" contain the code which is used to preprocess the dataset and calculate Average Values of each details in the dataset. The files "Build_ _Scores" contain the code which is used to generate individual scores/rank to each state of India based on the Average Values which we had calculated in the previous step.
<br><br>
The File "Build_Safe_Haven" contains the main code which generates the Hot Spot Rank and the Safe Haven Rank to each states of India.<br><br>
The files "Predict_Hot" and "Predict_Safe" contains the Linear Regression Code which is used to predict the individual scores based on the user provided values.<br><br>
### Here, the score has less value means the Average value will be high, so a Good Hotspot State will have a Lower Score.
